# RAG-Model-For-QA-Bot
The RAG Model for a QA Bot combines retrieval and generation techniques to provide accurate responses by using OpenAI API and Pinecone DB, continuously optimizing through user feedback.
he RAG Model for a QA Bot is an advanced question-answering system that combines retrieval and generation techniques to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses. By leveraging the OpenAI API for natural language generation and Pinecone DB for efficient document storage and retrieval, the model first retrieves relevant documents based on user queries and then synthesizes information to generate precise answers. Through continuous optimization techniques, such as enhanced query expansion and user feedback integration, this project aims to create a highly adaptive and intelligent QA bot that effectively meets the diverse needs of users and businesses.
